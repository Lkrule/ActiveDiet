## Exercises management :weight_lifting:
One of many concerns while working out, is to remember the number of sets, repetitions and even what's the exercise itself.</br>
Working out and getting results is based on progress that our body and mind are doing together, and the more consistent we are, the better!</br>
In order to help you, there is an easy to use exercise list that you can insert/delete/update and view your current exercise list that you want to follow :page_facing_up:.</br>
